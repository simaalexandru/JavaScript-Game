	/****************************
	
	Create a quiz based on the array "questions" ['question', correct answer].
	Each question must be presented using the prompt() method, allow user input and provide feedback using alert() - either "Correct!" or "Sorry. The correct answer is [correct number].)
	
	After the quiz is finished the overall result is published: "You got [number of correct answered questions] out of [questions in total] questions correct!"
	
	Additional challenge: 
	Use the JSON file 01_quiz.json as data source instead of the default array.
